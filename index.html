<h2>Textbook</h2>

<p>We will be using Gille's Castel's <a href="https://github.com/gillescastel/masterthesis/blob/master/final-version.pdf">Morse Theory</a>, a beautifully illustrated master's thesis following a similar trajectory to Milnor's <em>Lectures on the h-Cobordism Theorem</em>. The organizers haven't read it (yet!), but it looks extremely promising. The pictures also seem to surpass any other book on the subject.</p>

<h2>Website</h2>
<p>The code for the website is hosted on github, the easiest way to edit it is to ask the organizers to add you to the github repo. Then clone / update the repo, edit it, and publish changes with git.</p>

<p>If you're new to git, Udacity has <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123">a free git course</a> which teaches the basics in around six simple lessons. The instructor is also very <s>attractive</s> engaging.

<h2>Resources with comments</h2>
<em>Please add things and leave comments on what seems interesting and what does not.</em>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p><b>Morse Theory</b> (Milnor) &mdash; Part I is a classic introduction to Morse theory. However, the rest of the book is written very specifically to build up to a proof of Bott periodicity, which may be too specific a topic for the course.</p>

<p><b>Lectures on the h-Cobordism Theorem</b> (Milnor) &mdash; This book obviously has the specific purpose of proving the h-cobordism theorem. But the first five chapters actually give a broader picture of general Morse theory techniques than Milnor's <em>Morse Theory</em> book. After that point, the topics get more specific, but the coverage of the Whitney trick in Chapter 6 and Morse homology in Chapter 7 are still quite interesting. And the pay-off in Chapter 9 is pretty sweet.</p>

<p><b>Morse Homology</b> (Banyaga &amp; Hurtubise) &mdash; The organizers haven't read this one, but it has been highly recommended. Chapters 8-9 may be less interesting to non-symplectic folks, but Chapters 2-7 should be of broad appeal. This book is also a more friendly introduction than Schwarz's <em>Morse Homology</em>, which is supposed to be quite technical and relies more heavily on analysis background.</p>

<p><b>Differential Manifolds</b> (Kosinski) &mdash; The organizers haven't read this one either. This book <em>seems</em> like a mere introduction to differential topology, but the care given to details in the early chapters is useful, while the later chapters prove some really cool results. In fact, Kosinski proves the h-cobordism theorem by Chapter VII and then keeps on going to conclude the book with the Milnor-Kervaire classification of exotic spheres!</p>

<p><b>Morse Theory and Floer Homology</b> (Audin &amp; Damian) &mdash; Floer homology is a flourishing "spin-off" of Morse homology, with powerful applications to low-dimensional topology and symplectic geometry. However, this book is geared specifically towards the symplectic foundations and may be uninteresting to non-symplectic folks.</p>

<p><b>An Invitation to Morse Theory</b> (Nicolaescu) &mdash; The organizers don't know much about this book, but some people really like it. The selection of topics is quite broad and interesting, although some of Chapters 3-5 seem geared specifically towards symplectic and algebraic geometers.</p>

<p><b>Discrete Morse Theory (Scoville)</b> &mdash; The organizers don't know much about this, although it may be helpful for people interested in PL Morse theory.</p>

<p><b>Morse Theory: Smooth and Discrete</b> (Knudson) &mdash; This book is a very readable introduction to Morse theory. The theory for the smooth part is standard and there are many examples. The discrete part is a nice summary of the relatively new theory introduced by Forman, which has found a lot of application in Topological Data Analysis, particularly in speeding up homological computation.</p>

<h3>Theses</h3>

<p><b>Smooth and Discrete Morse Theory</b> &mdash;  An Australian colleague wrote his <a href="https://tqft.net/web/research/students/DominicWeiller/">honours thesis</a> on smooth and discrete Morse theory.</b>

<p><b>Morse Theory and the h-cobordism theorem</b> &mdash; Nikhil's honours thesis! It can be found on <a href="https://morosetheory.blogspot.com/2020/05/honors-thesis.html">his blog</a>.</p>

<h3>Papers</h3>

<p><b>Cerf Theory</b> &mdash; In any of the above books that cover h-cobordism, we learn how to modify Morse functions by adding/cancelling critical points via birth-death singularities. Cerf theory goes in the opposite direction to show that <em>any</em> two Morse functions on a manifold can be related by a sequence of modifications through birth-death singularities. This is fundamental in proving that Kirby calculus and its relatives <em>completely</em> characterize 3- and 4-manifolds.
    This topic also generalizes to parametrized Morse theory, which studies the space of all Morse functions on a manifold, with applications to the diffeomorphism groups of spheres and the algebraic K-theory of spaces.
<ul>
	<li>As far as the organizers know, Cerf's original papers have not been translated from French, but there is a nice survey in <a href="http://www.numdam.org/issue/AST_1973__6__1_0.pdf">Hatcher-Wagoner</a>. There is a much briefer survey from <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~katrin/papers/cerf.pdf">Gay, Wehrheim and Woodward</a>.</li> 
	<li>Igusa surveys parametrized Morse theory in the short paper "Parametrized Morse Theory and Its Applications." The organizers don't have the background to understand it (yet!), but it looks nice.</li>
	<li>There are also some textbooks that would make for good further topics in this direction. <em>Stable Mappings and Their Singularities</em> (Golubitsky &amp; Guillemin) is supposedly <em>the</em> book to learn the Thom-Boardman stratification that underlies Cerf theory. To learn some Kirby calculus, <em>4-Manifolds and Kirby Calculus</em> (Gompf &amp; Stipsicz) looks hard to beat.</li>
	<li>Cerf theory and parametrized Morse theory also factor into <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/Papers/SmaleConjecture.pdf">Hatcher's proof of the Smale conjecture</a> (the inclusion of \( O(4) \) into \( \text{Diffeo} (S^3) \) is a homotopy equivalence).</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Morse Homotopy and Field Theory</b> &mdash; The organizers don't fully understand what this is about, but we'd love to learn more. Starting with the work of Witten and Kontsevich (hard!), some of their ideas were taken up in really interesting ways by Fukaya, Betz, Cohen, Jones and Segal. This includes getting more information out of Morse homology (such as the cup product) by studying families of Morse functions simultaneously!</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fukaya has many early papers on the subject, some more accessible than others.</li>
	<li>There's also <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~ralph/graph.pdf">Betz-Cohen</a>, <a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/mgualt/Morse%20Theory/CohenJonesSegal.pdf">Cohen-Jones-Segal</a> and Betz's PhD thesis.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/forman3.pdf">This paper</a> by Forman describes some related stuff in discrete Morse theory.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.math.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~tadayuki.watanabe/Diff_S4.pdf">Tadayuki</a> recently used Morse homotopy to disprove the Smale conjecture in four dimensions (the inclusion of \( O(5) \) into \( \text{Diffeo}(S^4)\) is not a homotopy equivalence).</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Other topics</b>
<ul>
	<li>Klein's <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02568406.pdf">Coordinate-Free Morse Theory</a> seems like a really neat result.</li>
	<li>Everyone recommends <a href="http://www.numdam.org/article/PMIHES_1988__68__99_0.pdf">Morse Theory Indomitable</a>, but the organizers have not (yet) been able to follow any part after the entrance of Witten.</li>
	<li>Morse-Bott theory is also cool, but the organizers do not know of any resources beyond Banyaga-Hurtubise that aren't heavily biased towards either Riemannian or symplectic geometry.</li>
	<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0101268.pdf">Finite-volume Flows and Morse Theory</a>. David Nadler recommended this as an interesting framework in which to view Morse homology. It does seem cool, but it requires a fair amount of background on currents to read.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~bestvina/eprints/minicourse.pdf">PL Morse theory</a> gives a review of Morse theory, PL Morse theory, and applications.</li>
	<li>The handlebody and surgery tools that are developed in Morse theory make a wide vista of results more readily accessible. This includes the famed Lickorish-Wallace theorem, and some fun papers by our colleague <a href="https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/ml2437/#research">Max Lipton</a>. </li>
	<li>Picard Lefschetz Theory could also be interesting.</li>
